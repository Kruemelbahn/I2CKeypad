# I2CKeypad
Simple library for using a 4x4-keypad with Arduino.

This library was published in 2009 by Angel Sancho <angelitodeb@gmail.com> and could be found here:
http://arduino.cc/playground/Main/I2CPortExpanderAndKeypads

Changes where made by me regarding 'PIN MAPPING' and 'num_cols' to fit with my 4x4 keypads
used with ([DISPA](https://www.github.com/Kruemelbahn/DISPA) or [LocoIO-Editor](https://www.github.com/Kruemelbahn/LocoIO-Editor))

Please read also the comment in i2ckeypad.cpp for more informations.

A simple hardware for connecting a keypad to IÂ²C-bus can be found under [Hardware](Hardware).
